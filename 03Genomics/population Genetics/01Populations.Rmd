# Population

- Ideal population - gas like thing

- Fragmented population - Real situation.

  - Physical Barrier (mountain, rivers, ocean etc. which restrict access to mates)
    - Mating occur at random within sub population
    
**demes** alternative terms for subpopulation. local grouping which panmixia (random mating) occurs.

# Distributional characteristics of population

A. Dispersion (us of space $\bar{n}$ is the mean number of individuals per sample quadrat and $\sigma_{n}^{2}$ is the variance)

- Clumped ($\bar{n} < \sigma_{n}^{2}$)

- Random ($\bar{n} = \sigma_{n}^{2}$)

- Regular ($\bar{n} >> \sigma_{n}^{2}$)

B. Dispersal ()

# Elementary population growth

A. Exponential Growth ( Bacteria)


B. Logsitic Growh
