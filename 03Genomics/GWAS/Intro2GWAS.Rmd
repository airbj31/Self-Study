# Backgrounds

- Single Nucleotide Variants (SNVs, formally SNPs)

- Copy Number Variations (CNV)

- Structural Variants

- SNPs are by far the most abundant form of genetic variation in the human genome 

# Technical Supports

- Microarrays

- Next Generation Sequencings

# Important Questions in Human genetics

One of central goal of human genetics is to identify genetic risk factors for commom, complex diseases.

# Genome-Wide Association Studies

## What is the Genome-wide association studies ?

[A genome-wide association study](https://www.genome.gov/20019523/) is an approach that involves rapidly scanning markers across the complete sets of DNA, or genomes, of many people to find genetic variations associated with a particular disease and complex traits. 

Once new genetic associations are identified, researchers can use the information to develop better strategies to detect, treat and prevent the disease. Such studies are particularly useful in finding genetic variations that contribute to common, complex diseases, such as asthma, cancer, diabetes, heart disease and mental illnesses. 

## Why are such studies possible now ?

## How will genome-wide association studies benefit human health?

## What have genome-wide association studies found?

[GWAS CATALOG](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas/) [@Welter_index_2013] is major resouce for the result of GWA Studies. As of 2017-02-27, the GWAS catalog contains 2784 publications and 32189 Unique SNP-trait associations and currently mapped to Genome Assembly GRCh37.p7 and dbSNP build 147.

## Case-Control design

**Common control** 

 Welcome Trust Case-Control Consortium (WTCCC) study was demonstrate the effectuveness of a 'common control' design in which are 3,000 UK controls.[@Mark_index_2008]
 
 This design is the **potential loss of power** that is associated with the inability to exclude latent diagenoses of the phenotype of interest through intensive screening of controls.
 
### issues about case-control

- Sample-Size 
- Association is not Caucation.
