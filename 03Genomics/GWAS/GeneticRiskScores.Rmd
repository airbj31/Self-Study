**Genetic risk score** is an estimate of the cumulative contribution of genetic factors to a specific outcome of interest in an individual that take into account the rported risk alleles.

**Area under the curve (AUC)** The area under the curve (AUC) measures the predictive ability of a receiver operating
characteristic (ROC) generated based on the genetic risk scores for a sample of individuals. The AUC is a function of the ability of the risk score to correctly identify the presence (sensitivity) or absence (specificity) of the outcome of interest.
