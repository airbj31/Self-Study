# Introduction to genotyping issues

- A good SNP from Affy 500K.

> Well clustered SNP img.
> each point - indovodual
> outside clusters means that common homozygous and rare homozygous
> center cluster means the heterozygous.

> PTPN22 in the WTCCC
> Type 1 Diabetes have more rare homozygous allels than controls.


## Overview of difficulties
- A difficulty Affy 500k SNP
- separation of intensity is not enough.
- calling genotype between lower intensities are challenging
- Effect of Copy number variation
    - Copy number variation (common deletion / )generates noisy like clusters and it inhibits normal clustering
  
## Statistical framework

# Calling strategy

# Calling strategy

## One or two dimensional clustering

## Estimation techniques

## Additional refinements

# Differental bias, informative missingness
