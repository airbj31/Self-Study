## notations

* n : number of observation.

* p : number of variables that are available for use in making predictions.
  e.g) year,age,sex, and more..

* $x_{i,j}$ is element of an X matrix, representing the value of the jth variable for the
ith observation, where i = 1, 2,...,n and j = 1, 2,...,p.

$$ X = \left( \begin{array} {rrr}
x_{11} & \cdots & x_{1p} \\
\vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
x_{n1} & \cdots & x_{np} \\
\end{array} \right)
$$
