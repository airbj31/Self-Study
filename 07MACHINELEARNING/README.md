## Math Notations

* vector : 1-Dimensional array. normally expressed as

* n : number of observation.

* p : number of variables that are available for use in making predictions.
  e.g) year,age,sex, and more..

* $ x_{i,j} $ is element of an X matrix, representing the value of the jth variable for the
ith observation, where i = 1, 2,...,n and j = 1, 2,...,p.

$$ X = \left( \begin{array} {rrrr}
x_{11} & x_{12} & \cdots & x_{1p} \\
x_{21} & x_{22} & \cdots & x_{2p} \\
\vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
x_{n1} & \cdots & \cdots & x_{np} \\
\end{array} \right)
$$


* *x_{i}*

$$ x_{i} = \begin{pmatrix}
  x_{i1}  \\
  x_{i2}  \\
  \vdots \\
  x_{ip}  \\ \end{pmatrix}  $$


* ^T^ notation defines the transpose of a matrix of vector.


$$ X^{T} = \left( \begin{array} {rrrr}
x_{11} & x_{21} & \cdots & x_{n1} \\
x_{12} & x_{22} & \cdots & x_{n2} \\
\vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
x_{1p} & \cdots & \cdots & x_{np} \\
\end{array} \right)
$$
